This project is my professional portfolio.
It's useful because it will showcase all of the projects that I build and areas that I am strong in.
I learned what was important to include in a portfolio and how it should look, which is polished, easy on the eyes and responsive.![Screen Shot 2021-06-30 at 10 36 45 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78561316/125927674-68fa9c98-ce84-467d-adf0-167cde2d42b0.png)
